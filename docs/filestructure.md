# MIMIC Project File Structure Breakdown

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the purpose of each directory and file in the MIMIC project, excluding `__init__.py` and `__pycache__` files/directories.

## Root Level Files

- **main.py**: The main entry point of the application, likely containing the primary logic to run the MIMIC data processing or web application.
- **README.md**: Project documentation providing an overview, installation instructions, usage, and other relevant information.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project, used for installing packages via pip.
- **wget-log** and **wget-log.1**: Log files generated during data downloads using wget, capturing download progress and any errors.

## apps/ Directory

Contains the web application components for the project.

### apps/data/ Subdirectory

Handles data-related functionality for the web application.

- **config.py**: Configuration settings specific to data handling in the app, such as database connections or data source paths.
- **routes.py**: Defines the API routes and endpoints for the web application, handling HTTP requests related to data operations.

### apps/data/static/ Subdirectory

Stores static assets served by the web application.

### apps/data/templates/ Subdirectory

Contains HTML templates used for rendering dynamic web pages in the application.

## config/ Directory

Holds configuration files for the project.

- **base_config.py**: Base configuration file containing default settings and parameters used across the project.

## data/ Directory

Stores data files used or generated by the project.

- **icu_unique_subject_ids.csv**: A CSV file containing unique subject IDs from ICU data, used for data filtering or analysis.

## docs/ Directory

Contains documentation files for the project.

- **filestructure.md**: This file, providing a breakdown of the project's file structure and purposes.

## logs/ Directory

Intended for storing log files generated during application execution or data processing.

## notebooks/ Directory

Contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis and exploration.

- **data.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook for data analysis tasks, such as exploring, visualizing, or processing MIMIC data.

## physionet.org/ Directory

Contains downloaded content from PhysioNet.org, the repository hosting the MIMIC dataset.

## utils/ Directory

Contains utility modules and scripts for various project functions.

- **logger.py**: Utility for logging messages and events throughout the application.

### utils/analysis/ Subdirectory

Utilities for data analysis tasks.

- **create_lookup_index.py**: Script for creating lookup indices to facilitate fast data retrieval and querying.
- **filtering.py**: Module containing functions for filtering and subsetting data based on various criteria.

### utils/download/ Subdirectory

Utilities for downloading datasets.

- **download_dataset.py**: Script for downloading the MIMIC dataset or other required data from external sources.

### utils/hardware/ Subdirectory

Utilities related to hardware detection and management.

- **get_hardware.py**: Script for retrieving information about the system's hardware, such as CPU, memory, or GPU details.

### utils/tests/ Subdirectory

Contains test utilities and verification scripts.

- **verify_optimization.py**: Script for verifying and testing optimizations applied to data processing or analysis code.
